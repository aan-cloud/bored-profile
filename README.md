# Farhan: The software engineer

**Farhan** here, I've written thousands of line of _code_ , of course i'm a programmer.
<br />

But, is that's enought ?
<br />
 Actually, no. Writing a few line of code dosn't mean i'm a great programmer, A **Great programmer** has a deep understanding of programming paradigm, clean code, tools, problem solving, leadership, and much more.
<br />

Oh you mean you're a great programmer ?
<br />
Maybe, yeah.You can see my programming progress profile on [codewars](https://codewars.com)
